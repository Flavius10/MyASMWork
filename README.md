Description of Assembly Language (ASM) work during university:
During my university studies, I undertook a comprehensive study of Assembly Language (ASM) as part of my coursework in low-level programming. This subject provided me with a deep understanding of how computer hardware interacts with software, and how machine-level operations are implemented. I worked extensively on writing and debugging assembly code, which allowed me to gain insight into the fundamentals of computer architecture, memory management, and processor operations.

The projects I completed involved writing efficient, low-level algorithms in Assembly, optimizing code for performance, and using the underlying hardware resources to achieve specific computational goals. I was required to develop solutions that demonstrated a clear understanding of memory addressing, register usage, stack management, and interrupt handling.

Key aspects of my work in Assembly Language included:

    Writing and optimizing low-level algorithms for sorting, searching, and mathematical operations.

    Memory management: Understanding how to directly manipulate memory, working with pointers, and managing memory allocation manually.

    Processor architecture: Gaining hands-on experience with processor-specific operations and instructions, as well as learning how to write code for different processor architectures.

    Debugging and performance tuning: Using debugging tools to analyze and optimize Assembly code for speed and efficiency.

This experience has helped me develop a strong understanding of the relationship between software and hardware, improved my problem-solving abilities, and sharpened my attention to detail when it comes to writing efficient code. It also laid the foundation for my further studies in systems programming and computer architecture.
